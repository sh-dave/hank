This is a section of a Hank story. It's pretty much like a Knot in Ink.
Line breaks define the chunks of this section that will eventually get sent to your game to process.
Your Hank scripts will contain the static content of your game, but they can also insert dynamic content, even the result of complex Haxe expressions!
